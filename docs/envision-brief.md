# Envision, a DSL for predictive analytics

Envision is a DSL developed by Lokad for analytics and predictive optimization over business relational data, typically for supply chain purposes. Envision features array programming. It is strong-typed, imperative, functional, auto-distributed with a syntax reminiscent of Python and SQL.

An Envision script reads flat files (tables) as input from the Lokad filesystem, and produces a web dashboard as output. The web dashboard is made of _tiles_, the basic Envision construct to compose a dashboard. The output may also include flat files written to the Lokad filesystem.

Beware, Envision is indentation sensitive, like Python.
When entering a block (after `with`), the indentation increases by two whitespaces `  `.
When dedenting of two whitespaces `  `, the block is exited.

## Data types

The build-in value types of Envision are `boolean`, `number` (float32), `text`(like nvarchar(256)), `date` (no time of day), `ranvar` (1D probability distribution, Z->R, mass 1), `zedfunc` (1D function, Z->R).

```envision
// Booleans
b = true or false // `true`, operators: and or not
b = /* inline comment */ not b // `false`
b = 5 > 2 // `true`, operators: < > <= >= == !=

// Numbers
x = 1 + 2 * 3 // `7`, operators: + - * /
x = 5 mod 2 // `1`

// Texts
m = concat("a", "b", "c") // `abc`, variadic
m = text(123) // `text` function converts most types to text
m = text(true)
m = "X = \{x} and B = \{b}" // text interpolation via \{..}
n = strlen("abc") // 3

// Dates
d = date(2023, 9, 30) // `2023-09-30`
d = d + 1 // `2023-10-01`, add 1 day
d = d - 1 // `2023-09-31`, subtract 1 day
n = d - date(2023, 9, 29) // difference in days

// Ranvars
r = poisson(1) // Poisson, lambda = 1
r = r + poisson(1) // Poisson, lambda = 1

// Zedfuncs
f = linear(1) // f(x) = x
f = f + 1 + linear(f) // f(x) = 2x + 1
```

Beware, text literals use double-quote: `"hello"`.
Path literals, only used for schemas, use single-quotes: `'myfile.csv'`.
Do not attempt to use single-quote anywhere BUT in path schemas.

## Your first script

Every script must display at least _one_ dashboard _tile_. The following script illustrates how to generate a dashboard that contains a single tile displaying _Hello World!_.

```envision
greeting = "Hello World!" 
show label greeting
```

All the statements that start with the keyword `show` indicate that a _tile_ will be displayed. Tiles are the display mechanism provided by Envision. All the tiles present in a script are consolidated in a _dashboard_.

Attention that if we use "show label", the format should be 
```envision
show label labelContent
```
without writing "with" and the label does not have a title. this is different from show table : 
```envision
show table "ChartName" with tableContent
```

The value `"Hello World!"` is called a **text literal**, a value that appears verbatim in the code. The operator `=` is the **assignment operator**.

## Tables

Envision adopts array programming, processing whole columns at once, like SQL.
The `.` operator is used to specify the table, i.e. `MyTable.MyField`.

```envision
// `sku`  is the primary dimension of `Orders` (optional)
table Orders[sku] = with
  [| as sku, as Date          , as Qty, as Price , as Category |] // headers
  [| "a",    date(2020, 1, 17), 5     , 1.5      , "cat1"      |]
  [| "b",    date(2020, 2, 5) , 3     , 7.0      , "cat1"      |]
  [| "c",    date(2020, 2, 7) , 1     , 2.0      , "cat2"      |]
  [| "d",    date(2020, 2, 15), 7     , 5.7      , "cat2"      |]
 
// `Orders.Amount` is the vector `Amount` within `Orders`
Orders.Amount = Orders.Qty * Orders.Price // implicit loop, all lines at once

// `show` introduces a tile of type `table`. `a1b3` is the position of tile (like Excel cells A1 to B3).
show table "Total Sales by SKU" a1b3 with
  // `with` introduces a block (like `:` in Python), followed by extra indent.
  Orders.Category                              // 1st column, header `Category` (autogen)
  count(Orders.*) as "SKUs"                    // 2nd column, header `SKUs` (via `as`)
  sum(Orders.Amount) as "Amount" { unit:"$" }  // 3rd column, format via StyleCode `{..}`
  // `group by` only allowed with a `show` block (optional)
  group by Orders.Category
```

Specifying the primary dimension is optional.
Dimensions are lowercased by convention (not a requirement).

`count` and `sum` are aggregators.

Usually, tables are read from flat files:

```envision
// `expect [date]` means that `date` is a secondary dimension of `Orders`
// `Date[date]` is an auto-generated table. It spans the entire range of observed dates.
read "/sample/orders.csv" as Orders expect [date] with
  Date : date
  Quantity : number
 
show linechart "Daily Quantities" a1b4 with 
  sum(Orders.Quantity)
```

A more elaborate example:

```envision
// `id` primary dimension
read "/sample/items.tsv" as Items[id] with
  "Id" as id : text
  Name : text
  Brand : text

// `expect [date]` is the go-to-option to access to `Day[date]`, `Week[week]` and `Month[mont]` tables.
read "/sample/orders.tsv.gz" as Orders expect [id, date] with
  "Id" as id : text
  "Date" as date : date
  Quantity : number
  NetAmount : number
  Currency : text
 
lastOrderDate = max(Orders.Date) // Aggregate to the `Scalar` table by default
 
// Filtered tables: `Day`, `Week`, `Month` and `Orders`
// `Orders` is filtered too because is has `date` as secondary dimension (via `expect`).
where date >= lastOrderDate - 365 
  // The most frequently used currency during the last year
  currency = mode(Orders.Currency) when (date >= oend - 365)

  // Convert all amounts to this most frequent currency
  Orders.NetAmount = forex(Orders.NetAmount, Orders.Currency, currency, date)

  // `{ .. }` is StyleCode (a bit like CSS)
  show scalar "Turnover" d2 with 
    sum(Orders.NetAmount) { unit:#(currency) }
  show scalar "Orders lines" e2 with
    count(Orders.*)
  show scalar "Units" f2 with 
    sum(Orders.Quantity)
// De-indent, we have exited the scope of the `where` block

// Back to the global scope
show scalar "All units ever sold" d3 with
  sum(Orders.Quantity)
```

The `as` keyword is used to rename fields found in the flat file.

## Filtering tables

The `where` statement opens a new block where the table has been filtered.

```envision
table T = with
  [| as N |]
  [| 1 |] // line 1
  [| 2 |] // line 2
  [| 3 |] // line 3
table U = with
  [| as L |]
  [| "a" |] // line 1
  [| "b" |] // line 2

// Filtered tables: `T`
where T.N > 1 // lines left in `T`: 2, 3
  // Filtered tables: `U`
  where U.L != "a" // lines left in `U`: 2
    show scalar "T" a1 with count(T.*) // `2`
    show scalar "U" b1 with count(U.*) // `1`
  // end of `where U.L != "a"`
  show scalar "T" a2 with count(T.*) // `2`
  show scalar "U" b2 with count(U.*) // `2`
// end of `where T.N > 1`
show scalar "T" a3 with count(T.*) // `3`
show scalar "U" b3 with count(U.*) // `2`
```

A single `where` statement can filter more than 1 table.
When filtering a table, all its downstream tables are filtered too.

```envision
table T = with
  [| as N, as Cat |]
  [| 1, "a" |] // line 1
  [| 2, "a" |] // line 2
  [| 3, "b" |] // line 3

// `U` is a grouping table over `T`
table U[cat] = by T.Cat // `U` is now upstream of `T`, `T` is downstream of `U`.

// Filtered tables: `U`, `T`
where cat != "a" // lines left in `T`: 2, 3
  show scalar "T" a1 with count(T.*) // `1`
  show scalar "U" b1 with count(U.*) // `1`
// end of `U.Cat != "a"`
show scalar "T" a2 with count(T.*) // `3`
show scalar "U" b2 with count(U.*) // `2`
```

## Block scopes

A variable created in the scope of a block cannot be used outside its original scope.

The script below does not compile:

```envision
// Create a table with 5 lines
table T = extend.range(5) // special, auto create `T.N : number`

// `T.X` is defined for the whole table `T`
T.X = "A"

// Filtered tables: `T`
where T.N >= 4 // Filtered tables: `T`
  // entering the `where` block, +2 indent
  T.X = "B"
  T.Y = "C" // `T.Y` belong to the scope of the `where` block
// exiting the `where` block, -2 indent

// The `show` has no indent
show table "T" a1b2 with
  T.X // good
  T.Y // WRONG, fails with `Undefined variable T.Y`
```

It can be fixed with:

```envision
// Create a table with 5 lines
table T = extend.range(5) // special, auto create `T.N : number`

// `T.X` is defined for the whole table `T`
T.X = "A"

// Filtered tables: `T`
where T.N >= 4
  T.X = "B"
  T.Y = "C" // `T.Y` belong to the scope of the `where` block

  // The `show` is indented, we are still in the `where` block
  show table "T" a1b2 with
    T.X // good
    T.Y // good
```

## Calendar tables

In order to display time-series, Envision offers 3 special tables: `Day[date]`, `Week[week]` and `Month[month]`.

```envision
// `expect [date]` auto-creates tables `Day`, `Week` and `Month`
read "/sales.csv" as Sales expect [date] with
  "SalesDate" as date : date
  SalesQty : number
  SalesUsd : number

// here `max(Sales.date)` would be the same
salesEnd = max(date) 

// Filtered tables: `Day`, `Week`, `Month` and `Sales`
// Tables with `date` as a secondary dimension (aka `expect`) are filtered too.
// Thus, the tables `Week`, `Month` and `Sales` are filtered too
where date > salesEnd - 365
  Month.Qty = sum(Sales.SalesQty)
  Month.Usd = sum(Sales.SalesUsd)
  show linechart "Monthly USD (last 365 days)" a6b8 with
    // entering the `show` block, +2 indent
    Month.Qty
    Month.Usd
// dedent, exiting the `where` block
show scalar "Total sales ever" with sum(Sales.SalesUsd)
// `Day.Qty` is undefined here, as we have exited its definition scope (due to dedent).
// Idem `Month.Qty` and `Month.Usd` are also undefined here.
```

Calendar tables are auto-created by having a `read` statement with `expect [date]`.
To extend the range of `Day` into the future use `span`.

## Tiles

Running an Envision script produces a dashboard, and the dashboard is composed of tiles. Envision supports multiple tiles.

```envision
table T = extend.range(10)
T.X = random.poisson(5 into T) // 'into' broadcasts scalar '5' into table 'T'
T.G = "G\{T.N}"
 
// Horizontal bars
show barchart "My Groups" a1b8 with
  sum(T.X) // must be a number
  max(T.X) // 
  group by T.G // required for 'barchart'
```

```envision
table T = extend.range(1000)
T.X = random.poisson(5 into T)
 
 // Vertical bars
show histogram "My histogram" a1f4 with T.X
```

```envision
// Day, Week and Month, the special calendar tables are implicitely created by 'span'
// (other way: use 'read' with '[date]'  as secondary dimension)
keep span date = [date(2021, 5, 1) .. date(2021, 7, 30)] 
 
Day.X = random.poisson(5 into Day)
Week.X = sum(Day.X)
Month.X = sum(Day.X)
 
show linechart "Daily (2 lines)" a1b4 with 
  Day.X
  Day.X + 3 as "X shifted" { color: "red" } // web colors 
show linechart "Weekly" a5b6 with Week.X
show linechart "Monthly" a7b8 with Month.X
```

```envision
keep span date = [date(2021, 5, 3) .. date(2021, 7,6)]
 
def pure isTuesday(d : date) with // pure function
  return d == monday(d) + 1 // body of the function
def pure isWeekend(d: date) with
  return d >= monday(d) + 5
 
// Flat replenishments of 120 units on Tuesdays.
Day.Restock = if not(isTuesday(date)) then 0 else 120 // ternary
 
// Simulating a random demand that increases on the weekend.
Day.Demand = random.ranvar(poisson(15 into Day)) // 'into' broadcasts scalar into 'Day' table
Day.Demand = if isWeekend(date) then floor(Day.Demand * 1.2 + 5) else Day.Demand
 
// Positive cumulative sum to prevent negative stock.
def process positiveCumsum(n : number) with
  keep sum = 0 // 'keep' defines the state of the process, 'sum' is persisted across calls
  sum = max(0, sum + n)
  return sum
 
Day.Stock = positiveCumsum(Day.Restock - Day.Demand) scan date
Day.Sales = Day.Stock[-1] - Day.Stock + Day.Restock // [-1] lags the table (only for calendar tables)
 
show linechart "Stock level simulator" a1h6 { legendPosition: left ; vaxis { left { axisMax: 500 } } } with
  Day.Restock as "Daily restock" { seriesType: bar ; unit: " stock" ; color:#7e7 }
  Day.Stock as "End of day stock" { seriesType: bar ; seriesOpacity: 0.6; unit: " stock" ; color:#666 }
  Day.Sales as "Daily sales" { seriesType: line ; color: gray ; seriesStack:"stackSales" ; unit: " sold" }
  Day.Demand - Day.Sales as "Unsatisfied demand" { seriesType: area ; seriesOpacity: 0.6 ; seriesStack:"stackSales" ; unit:" sold"; color:#fa0 }
  if isWeekend(date) then 1 else 0 { seriesType: background ; seriesLegend: hidden ; seriesOpacity: 0.25 ; color: #f99 }
  group by date
```

```envision
// Markdown is both a data type and a tile type.

// Single line markdown literal
m = """Hello **World**"""
show markdown "" a1b2 with m

// Multi-line markdown literal
show markdown "" a3b6 with """
# Part A
## Subpart A.1
A list of **important** remarks.
 
* remark 1
* remark 2
* remark 3
 
## Subpart A.2
# Part B

"""
```

```envision
table T = with 
  [| as Product, as Country |]
  [| "Shirt", "FR" |]
  [| "Hat", "FR" |]
  [| "Shirt", "UK" |]
  [| "Shoes", "UK" |]
 
T.Sales = random.poisson(10 into T)
 
show piechart "Sales per product" a1c6 with
  sum(T.Sales)
  group by T.Product
```

```envision
// The 'scalar' tile works with most data types (but only single scalar)
show scalar "options" a1b1 {tileColor: "red" ; unit: "$" } with 123 // {..}, StyleCode

myDate = date(2022, 2, 17)
onHand = 123
onOrder = 42
unitPrice = 25
 
 // The 'summary' tile supports multiple scalar values
show summary "Key figures" a2b4 with
  "Contoso A-001" as "Product Name"
  myDate
  onHand
  onOrder
  onHand + onOrder as "Total units" 
  (onHand + onOrder) * unitPrice as "Total value" {unit: "$"}
```

```envision
table T = extend.range(50)
T.X = random.uniform(0 into T, 1) 
T.Y = random.uniform(0 into T, 1)

// Display a set of 2D points, expects exactly 2 vectors as argument.
show scatter "" a1d6 with
  T.X 
  T.Y { value { color: #[if T.X > 0.5 then "blue" else "red"] } }
```

## StyleCode

Envision features a sub-language named StyleCode, inspired by CSS, to modify the tiles look & feel.

```envision
table Products = with
 [| as Product, as Color |]
 [| "pants", "blue" |]
 [| "shirt", "pink" |]
 [| "socks", "green"|]
 
show table "My Products" a1b3 with
  Products.Product { textColor: #[Products.Color] } // curly brackets {} for StyleCode
  Products.Color
```

## Glossary

This glossary lists key concepts that permeate Envision and its environment.

**scalar**: the simplest kind of variable that holds just one value. A scalar does not have a dot (.) in its name. Ex: `myValue`.

**table**: a tabular dataset that typically includes multiple vectors. Tables are usually populated based on the content of flat files.

**vector**: a specific kind of variable that contains a vector of values (in the mathematical sense for "vector"). A vector has a dot (.) in its name. The first part, before the dot, is the table that contains the vector. Ex: `Products.Color`.

**page**: a segment of values within a vector. Large vectors may require multiple pages. The option `small` ensures that vectors of a given table do not spread over multiple pages. Certain capabilities of Envision only work with single-page tables, i.e. small tables. The maximal page size depends on the type of the vector.

**function**: a named set of operations leveraging data passed as argument(s). Functions have no side-effects. Functions can be built-in or user-defined.

**process**: a type of function that can be applied to an array of values to produce either cumulative values (an aggregation) or a final value (scan).  Most aggregators and accumulators are _processes_. Ex: `sum( .. )`

**call option**: a small set of standardized options to alter the behavior of a process, for example by imposing a specific grouping or a sorting order. Ex: `first( .. ) sort ..`

**statement**: a stand-alone piece of code that usually fits on a single line. The two most notable statements are assignments and filters.

**block**: a series of statements and blocks that all have the same indentation level. Blocks are introduced by specific statements, such as filters or processes declaration. To exit the block, just de-indent.

**filter**: a kind of statement that restricts the data that exists in the block that follows the filter statement, typically using the reserved keyword `where`. Filters can be nested.

**downstream / upstream**: If table T is upstream of U, then for each line of U, there is one and only one line associated in T, thus both `U.X = T.X` (broadcasting T in U) and `T.X = aggregator(U.X)` (aggregating U in T) are legit. If table T is upstream of U, then table U is downstream of T.

**read statement**: a kind of statement that defines how data is loaded from files into tables.

**schemas**: A _named schema_ specifies the content of a table (column names and types). Schemas are intended to stabilize and document the format of the tabular files either written or read by Envision scripts. A _path schema_ also specifies the placement of the files.

**show statement**: a kind of statement that defines a tile to be rendered in the resulting dashboard.

**tile**: a construct that takes vectors as input and produce a visual block in the dashboard (ex: a linechart).

**def statement**: a kind of statement introducing a user-defined function.
