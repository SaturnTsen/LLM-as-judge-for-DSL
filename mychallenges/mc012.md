```envision
table Orders[Pid] = with
  [| as Pid, as Date, as Quantity |]
  [| "apple",  date(2020, 4, 15), 3 |]
  [| "pear",  date(2020, 4, 16), 7 |]
  [| "orange", date(2020, 4, 17), 2 |]
```
How can I show the date of orange ?

```envision
table Orders[Pid] = with
  [| as Pid, as Date, as Quantity |]
  [| "apple",  date(2020, 4, 15), 3 |]
  [| "pear",  date(2020, 4, 16), 7 |]
  [| "orange", date(2020, 4, 17), 2 |]
show scalar "" with Orders.Date["orange"] // 'Apr 17, 2020'
```
